# Gap-Clone-project
Project



I have a background in fashion design and visual arts, I wanted to incorporate my eye for color, balance and shapes into my project.  I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to recreate the Gap brand website.  I wanted to create a website that was beautiful, easy to navigate and engaging.  

To run locally:

1.-Download Visual Code 

2. Clone the repository:  https://github.com/sher1980/Gap-Clone-project

3. Open the downloaded repository with Visual Studio Code

How to get around the site?

#Three pages:
1. First-page.html
2. Womens-page.html
3. Input-Form.html

The “Women” link will take you to the “Women’s-page. The embedded YouTube video can  be played for your enjoyment or paused if you prefer quiet, it’s your choice.   

“The Sign in/ Login” link will take you to the “Input-form” page.  You should get an error message if the user name is less than three letters and less than 6 characters for the password.

All page are mobile friendly. 

-The List
 
Retrieve data from a third-party API and use to display within app: I embedded a Youtube API into the women’s section of my app. The user will be able to play and pause the video.

Calculate and display data based on external factor:  I integrated a count-down clock using JavaScript. The count-down clock displays days, hours, minutes and seconds till Christmas. 

Use a regular expression to validate user input: I created a form that prevents the user from entering a password that this less than 6 characters; and that also return errors when the name and email isn’t provide by the user.
